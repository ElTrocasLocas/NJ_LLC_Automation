Things to add in the future:
Variables instead of text for the company name, members, addresses, zip code, company purpose
Add try and catch to every await page, (click,select,write) so it doesn't crash if the page is slow
Add line of code in the company address and member address where the state can be other than NJ based on an imput/variable
Add the possibilty of adding more members instead of just one
